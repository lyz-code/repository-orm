When modeling the application logic through [Domain Driven
Design](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/architecture/domain_driven_design/),
you usually need the following object types:

* *Value object*: Any domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it
    holds, so it has no conceptual identity. They should be treated as
    immutable. We can still have complex behaviour in value objects.
    In fact, it's common to support operations, for example, mathematical
    operators.

* *Entity*: An object that is not defined by it's attributes, but rather by
    a thread of continuity and it's identity. Unlike values, they have *identity
    equality*. We can change their values, and they are still recognizably the
    same thing.

# Entities

We've created the [Entity][repository_pattern.model.Entity] class based on the
pydantic's `BaseModel` to enforce that they have the `ID` attribute and they can
be compared and hashed based on that attribute.
