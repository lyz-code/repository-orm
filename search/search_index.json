It hides the boring details of data access by pretending that all of our data is in memory. It has the following advantages: Give a simple interface, which you control, between persistent storage and our domain model. It's easy to make a fake version of the repository for unit testing, or to swap out different storage solutions, because the model is fully decoupled from the infrastructure. Writing the domain model before thinking about persistence helps focus on the problem at hand. If we need to change our approach, we can do that in our model, without needing to worry about foreign keys or migrations until later. Our database schema is simple because we have complete control over how we map our object to tables. Speeds up and makes more clean the business logic tests. It's easy to implement. But the following disadvantages: An ORM already buys you some decoupling. Changing foreign keys might be hard, but it should be pretty easy to swap between MySQL and Postres if you ever need to. Maintaining ORM mappings by hand requires extra work and extra code. An extra layer of abstraction is introduced, and although we may hope it will reduce complexity overall, it does add complexity locally. Furthermore it adds the WTF factor for Python programmers who've never seen this pattern before. repository-orm aims to mitigate the last ones by: Supplying classes that already have the common operations for different storage solutions.

Entity : An object that is not defined by it's attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and it's identity. Unlike values, they have identity equality . We can change their values, and they are still recognizably the same thing.

All repository types are run against the same tests . Using the awesome library pytest-cases , we were able to separate the test cases from the test functions. The result is not simple to understand, but bear with me, as once you understand it, you may love it. The test cases are in the cases directory below tests . There are two files: entities.py : Where we define the different Entity objects to test through the methods of the EntityCases class. repositories.py : Where we define the different Repository objects to test through the methods of the RepositoryCases class. The Entity cases, return a factory defined with Factoryboy together with the Entity model, to create arbitrary objects with real values generated through Faker . The Repository cases are a little more complex, each of them returns a tuple with the following objects: db : A storage connection object to run direct queries in the tests. empty_repo : A repository instance without the schema applied. repo : A repository instance with the schema applied. repo_tester : A class to particularize the testing interface to each repository. Each repository needs different assertions to ensure that a functionality works as expected, this fact makes it really difficult to parametrize the tests.

It's meant for the stages of the project where the schema is more stable and you need the improved performance of these types of databases. It stores the persisted Entities into a SQLite database tables ( Mysql support will come in the future ). It uses the Pypika query builder to generate the raw SQL statements and then sends them to the database through an sqlite3 connection. If you're wondering why we don't want to use SQLAlchemy or raw sql statements, check this article. Load it with: from repository_orm import load_repository repo = load_repository ( 'sqlite://path/to/database.db' ) Database schema \u00b6 The repository assumes there is a specific schema, where the table names are the same as the Entity clases in lowercase, and the columns are called as the attributes. All tables must have an id column. Following the overview example , the database should contain one table called author with the columns id , first_name , last_name and country .

Once the object is initialized with the database url with the format sqlite:///path_to_database_file , an sqlite3 Connection object is saved in the connection attribute, and a first Cursor is saved to the cursor attribute. If you need to execute new queries, use the _execute method, it accepts a Pypika Query object. To extract the Pypika Table from an identity object, use the _table static method, or the _table_model if you use an identity class instead. Keep in mind that if you use the internal methods, like _execute , in your program, you're breaking the Liskov substitution principle and you won't be able to switch to other type of repository. If you need a functionality that is not implemented, create a public method and define it for the repositories that you want to use. Take a look at the contributing page, and think of adding it to the library.

Proposals \u00b6 We can: Assume that the model functions that create the new entities receive the new entity id as an argument. Change the definition of the id_ attribute so that it can be set by the repository at the moment of adding it to the repository. I've started using the first in pydo and found it cumbersome.

Right now the entity_model is a mandatory argument for these methods, that means that the code calling the repository needs to be aware of all the entity models inside the repository and call the methods for each of them. Proposals \u00b6 To solve it, we should change the entity_model an argument to a more flexible type Union[Type[Entity], List[Type[Entity]], None] . That change carries some side effects: We need to add logic at repository level to process one, a subset or all the entity types. Some repositories (tinydb and pypika) used the entity_model to build the entity, if it's not specified, we need to build the logic that lets them build the entities from their data. The calls to the methods without specifying the entity_model can have a worse performance. Build the Entities from their data \u00b6 To build the entities from the data we need those methods to be able to link that data to a model type, we can either: Delegate that functionality to the application using the repository. Configure the repositories in a way that we can deduce the model from the data stored in itself. The first solution means that each application will need to implement and maintain that code, which will lead to more maintenance and duplicated code, but a simpler repository configuration. The second solution will mean that the code for the methods is more complex and/or the repository initialization needs more arguments. We already store the key information that tells which model does the data belong to. In the tinydb repo it's stored as an attribute _model_type , and in the pypika repo is stored as tables names. The fake repo doesn't have this problem. If we initialize the repository with a models optional argument, with a list of the entity models, we can create an internal models attribute that holds a dictionary with the key equal to the value stored in the repos, and the value the model type. If the user doesn't provide this argument at repo initialization, it will be supposed that it will give the entity_model on each of the repo methods that require it, otherwise an error will be shown. Performance loss \u00b6 The entity_model acted as a filter on the amount of data to perform the operations, if the user doesn't specify it, the repo needs to work with more data and therefore be slower. Maybe some of the methods like all , first , or last will work faster on some repositories based on how they or their libraries work, but the get and search will definitely go slower. In the case of get we can mitigate it with an optional callable argument that can run regexps on the id to select the subset of entity models that contain id's of that type. Decision \u00b6 Change the signatures of the get , search , all , first and last methods to accept one, many or no Entity subclasses. If none is given, it will assume that the repository was initialized with the models argument, where the user gives the repo the model of the data it holds. For the sake of cleanness, we're renaming entity_models for models in the function arguments. Consequences \u00b6 The change makes the library more usable while it retains the performance of the previous code base.
